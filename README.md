# Chess
Java program that implements text-based chess.

# How it works
The program draws the chess board in text, on the terminal and prompts whomever's turn it is (white or black) for a move. Once the move is executed, the move is played and the new board is drawn, and the other player queried. 

# Implementation
* All legitimate basic moves for all pieces
* Castling
* Enpassant
* Promotion
* Identification of check/checkmate
* Identification of illegal moves
* Resign/Draw
